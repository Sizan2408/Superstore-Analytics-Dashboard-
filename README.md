## Project Overview
The Superstore Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI project designed to analyze sales, profit, and customer behavior for a retail superstore. This interactive dashboard helps businesses track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profit margins, return rates, and geographical sales distribution. By leveraging data visualization and DAX calculations, this report provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making and business growth.

## Business Problem
Retail businesses often struggle with understanding sales trends, customer segmentation, and product profitability. Without proper data analytics, it becomes difficult to optimize inventory, improve customer targeting, and enhance overall sales strategies. This project aims to solve these challenges by:

- Providing a centralized dashboard for tracking sales and profit trends.
- Identifying top-performing cities, segments, and product categories.
- Analyzing year-over-year (YoY) sales growth to forecast future trends.

## Key Insights & Features
- Sales & Profit Overview – Total revenue, profit, and return percentage compared to the previous year.
- Top 5 Cities by Sales – Identifying the best-performing locations to enhance regional marketing strategies.
- Sales by Segment – Understanding consumer behavior across different business segments.
- Profit by Product Category – Highlighting the most and least profitable product categories.
- Sales Trends Over Time – Comparing current vs. previous year’s sales for better forecasting.
- Return Analysis – Evaluating return percentages to improve operational efficiency.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Power BI – Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
- Power Query – Data transformation, cleaning, and modeling.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom calculations for sales, profit margin, and ranking.
- Time Intelligence Functions – Year-over-year (YoY) comparisons, moving averages, and YTD calculations.
- Filters & Slicers – Allowing users to drill down into specific insights.

## DAX Calculations Used
- Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales]) 
- Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
- Top 5 Cities = RANKX(ALL(Sales[City]), SUM(Sales[Sales]), , DESC, DENSE)
